Number polyfill
================

This is a polyfill for implementing the HTML5 <tt><input type="number"></tt> element in browsers that do not currently support it.

Usage
===============

Using it is easy â€” simply include the **number-polyfill.js** file in the HEAD of the HTML page. You can then use <tt><input type="number"></tt> elements normally.

If Modernizr detects that the browser doesn't support <tt><input type="number"></tt>, the script will search for these elements and attach some Javascript to them to make them function as number-only input fields, and add increment/decrement buttons.

A default CSS file is provided. You may edit this file to style the buttons to make them look the way you want.

Dependencies
==============

This script requires [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/).
